# Memahami Ruang Lingkup Pengembangan Software

## 1. Information technology

**Information technology (IT)** is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data, or information, often in the context of a business or other enterprise.<br>
Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC, but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT).

## 2. What's the difference between Computer Science and Informatics?

- ### Computer Science
>Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.
- ### Informatics
>Informatics is a branch of information engineering. It involves the practice of information processing and the engineering of information systems, and as an academic field it is an applied form of information science. The field considers the interaction between humans and information alongside the construction of interfaces, organisations, technologies and systems. As such, the field of informatics has great breadth and encompasses many subspecialties, including disciplines of computer science, information systems, information technology and statistics.

## 3. Software development

Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components. Software development is a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, sometimes in a planned and structured process.<br>
### Software development activities
- #### Identification of need
The sources of ideas for software products are plentiful. These ideas can come from market research including the demographics of potential new customers, existing customers, sales prospects who rejected the product, other internal software development staff, or a creative third party.
- #### Planning
Planning is an objective of each and every activity, where we want to discover things that belong to the project. An important task in creating a software program is extracting the requirements or requirements analysis.[6] Customers typically have an abstract idea of what they want as an end result but do not know what software should do.
- #### Designing
Once the requirements are established, the design of the software can be established in a software design document. This involves a preliminary or high-level design of the main modules with an overall picture (such as a block diagram) of how the parts fit together. The language, operating system, and hardware components should all be known at this time.
- #### Implementation, testing and documenting
**Implementation** is the part of the process where software engineers actually program the code for the project<br>
**Software testing** is an integral and important phase of the software development process.<br>
**Documenting** the internal design of software for the purpose of future maintenance and enhancement is done throughout development. This may also include the writing of an API, be it external or internal.
- #### Deployment and maintenance
**Deployment** starts directly after the code is appropriately tested, approved for release, and sold or otherwise distributed into a production environment.<br>
**Maintaining** and enhancing software to cope with newly discovered faults or requirements can take substantial time and effort, as missed requirements may force redesign of the software.

## 4. Agile software development

Agile software development comprises various approaches to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customers/end users. It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

### The Manifesto for Agile Software Development
- #### Agile software development values
Based on their combined experience of developing software and helping others do that, the seventeen signatories to the manifesto proclaimed that they value:
>1. **Individuals and Interactions** over processes and tools
>2. **Working Software** over comprehensive documentation
>3. **Customer Collaboration** over contract negotiation
>4. **Responding to Change** over following a plan

- #### Agile software development principles
The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:
>1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
>2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
>3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
>4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
>5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
>6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
>7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
>8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
>9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
>10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
>11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
>12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

## 5. Scrum (software development)
Scrum is an agile process framework for managing complex knowledge work, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields and is slowly starting to be explored for other complex work, research and advanced technologies.
### Workflow
#### 1. Sprint
A sprint (also known as iteration or timebox) is the basic unit of development in Scrum. The sprint is a timeboxed effort; that is, the length is agreed and fixed in advance for each sprint and is normally between one week and one month, with two weeks being the most common.
#### 2. Sprint planning
Sprint Planning is an event in scrum that defines what can be delivered in the upcoming sprint and how that work will be achieved.
#### 3. Daily scrum
Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint. At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours. This optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting upcoming Sprint work. The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.
#### 4. Sprint review
Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. There could have been a single Sprint Reviewdeployment or many deployments during a Sprint which lead up to that Increment to be inspected.
#### 5. Sprint retrospective
The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. This is at most a three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose. This is the opportunity for the Scrum Team to improve and all member should be in attendance.
#### 6. Backlog refinement
Backlog refinement (formerly called grooming) is the ongoing process of reviewing product backlog items and checking that they are appropriately prepared and ordered in a way that makes them clear and executable for teams once they enter sprints via the sprint planning activity. Product backlog items may be broken into multiple smaller ones. Acceptance criteria may be clarified. Dependencies may be identified and investigated.
#### 7. Cancelling a sprint
The product owner can cancel a sprint if necessary.[16] The product owner may do so with input from the team, scrum master or management. For instance, management may wish the product owner to cancel a sprint if external circumstances negate the value of the sprint goal. If a sprint is abnormally terminated, the next step is to conduct a new sprint planning, where the reason for the termination is reviewed.

## 6. Extreme Programming
Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent "releases" in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.
